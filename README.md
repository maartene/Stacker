## About
Simple physics stack game for iOS based on SpriteKit. Usable as a demonstration of SpriteKit and Swift.

* targets: iOS 12.4+;
* see GameScene.swift for actual game logic. Code contains comments;
* Sprites made using Pixelmator. You require that program if you want to edit them.

## Known issues
* Occassionaly, SpriteKit is unable to generate a collider (SKPhysicsBody) for the non-square blocks. This unfortunately is not consistent behaviour. It might be an issue with the textures, it might be a bug in SpriteKit, it might be both.
